# Tech Blog
The tech blog was created to allow developers to publish blog posts and comment on other blog posts.

## Description

The tech blog aides developers in interacting with one another. Users can create blog posts and interact with one another by commenting on other blog posts. Users are presented with the homepage. If they don't have an account, they are able to see existing blog posts, but are not able to comment. Users can then sign up or sign in. Then, they are able to create blog posts and comment on other posts. They can also update blog posts they've written and posted. If a user decides to revisit the site at a later time, login information persists.
